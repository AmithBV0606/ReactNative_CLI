# React-Native

### Introduction

- When it comes to developing mobile applications using React Native, developers have two main options: Expo and React Native CLI. Both approaches have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. 

- As we go on, we’ll explore the key differences between Expo and React Native CLI, their pros and cons, and when to choose each approach

# Expo vs React Native CLI

## Expo

- Simplified Development Experience Expo is a framework and platform for building React Native applications. 

- It aims to provide a simplified development experience by abstracting away some of the complexities involved in setting up and configuring a React Native project.

### Advantages of Expo

1. **Quick Start :** Expo allows you to quickly start developing your app without worrying about device-specific setup or native code dependencies.

2. **Over-the-Air Updates :** With Expo, you can deploy updates to your app directly to user devices without requiring them to download a new version from the app store.

3. **Access to Pre-built Libraries :** Expo provides a wide range of pre-built libraries and APIs, making it easy to add features like push notifications, in-app purchases, and maps to your app.

4. **Simplified Build Process :** Expo handles the build process for you, abstracting away the need to configure build tools and deal with native code compilation.

5. **EAS :** With Expo, you don’t need a mac to build the app for iOS. You can have the code built and deployed to EAS in the cloud. From there you can directly deploy it to the store.

6. **Native Physical Device :** With Expo, you can have the Expo Go app installed in your mobile and connect over the same network and get your app tested on any physical device [both Android and iOS].

### Disadvantages of Expo:

1. **Limited Native Modules :** Expo restricts access to certain native modules, which means you may encounter limitations when trying to integrate certain third-party libraries or accessing low-level device features.

2. **Less Control Over the Build :** With Expo, you have less control over the build configuration and customization options compared to React Native CLI.

3. **Size and Performance :** Expo apps tend to have a larger bundle size compared to React Native CLI apps, which can impact download and loading times. Additionally, certain performance optimizations may not be available in Expo.

## React Native CLI

- React Native CLI is the traditional approach for building React Native apps. 

- It provides maximum flexibility and control over your project setup and configuration.

### Advantages of React Native CLI:

1. **Full Native Module Support :** React Native CLI allows you to access and integrate any native module available in the React Native ecosystem, giving you the flexibility to leverage a wide range of third-party libraries and device capabilities.

2. **Customization Options :** You have complete control over the build configuration, allowing you to fine-tune your app’s performance, size, and behavior.

3. **Ecosystem Compatibility :** React Native CLI is fully compatible with the entire React Native ecosystem, including all community libraries and tools.

### Disadvantages of React Native CLI:

1. **Steeper Learning Curve :** React Native CLI requires more initial setup and configuration, which can be overwhelming for developers new to React Native or mobile app development.

2. **Longer Development Setup Time :** Setting up a React Native CLI project involves installing and configuring native dependencies, which can take longer compared to getting started with Expo.

3. **Manual Build Process :** React Native CLI requires you to manually configure build tools, which can be more time-consuming and complex, especially for developers unfamiliar with native app development.

4. **Native Physical Device :** React Native CLI requires you to have physical platform specific devices for testing your app in Android and iOS. For iOS, you would surely need a Mac to build and test your app.
